[raect client code](https://github.com/tigawanna/sockets-client)
### scripts

For development clone the repo
```js

Works with a simple nodejs backeend [server code](https://github.com/tigawanna/sockets-server)
[Built apkfor android](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GMfPdDjFU3Uepw8I6FrAUbkGQ-k_trOR/view?usp=drivesdk)
the linked apk has not been reviewed by google and will give you warnings. also it's a react native app so it's bound to be chonky

Just hop in and chat , messages are broadcast to all the clients currently connected and no data is persisted on the server .
